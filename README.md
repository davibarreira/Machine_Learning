### Course at Fundação Getúlio Vargas

This repository contains the final presentation for the course.
The theme was Generative Adversarial Networks.

The presentation is mainly based in the seminal paper "[Generative
Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf)"
by Goodfellow et al. (2014).

There is also a notebook with a GAN implementation using Keras.
