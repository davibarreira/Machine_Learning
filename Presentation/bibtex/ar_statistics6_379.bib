    abstract = { Many of the statistical models that could provide an accurate, interesting, and testable explanation for the structure of a data set turn out to have intractable likelihood functions. The method of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has become a popular approach for tackling such models. This review gives an overview of the method and the main issues and challenges that are the subject of current research. }
